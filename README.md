WEATHER FORECAST APP

I have created a weather forecast app using concepts that include css,bootstrap,java script and html. This app shows the current weather conditions and weather forecast for next 7 days by giving city name as a input.User should give his city name to see the required details or else webpage shows error. By default,location is set to as delhi.

I have attached html,css,js files that are used to create this app.

The Webpage interface will look like this:
